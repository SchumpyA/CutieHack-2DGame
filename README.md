# An unfathomable amount of time ago, before the heavens coalesced into a liveable form there was the primordial void.
# The beings born from this void were the first lifeforms and were blessed with unbelievable power.
# One of these beings was Drakonios dragoon the primordial dragon lord of the final first embers of forgotten dreams and time.
# His egg was the first thing to ever truely exist.
# However he was unable to hatch.
# This fact angered him so much at he began to dispise the world around him.
# Finally, one year ago, a crack formed along his egg as his hatred broke through the confines of his prison.
