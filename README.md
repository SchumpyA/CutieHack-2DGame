 An unfathomable amount of time ago, before the heavens coalesced into a liveable form there was the primordial void.
 The beings born from this void were the first lifeforms and were blessed with unbelievable power.
 One of these beings was Drakonios dragoon the primordial dragon lord of the final first embers of forgotten dreams and time.
 His egg was the first thing to ever truely exist.
 However he was unable to hatch.
 This fact angered him so much at he began to dispise the world around him.
 Finally, one year ago, a crack formed along his egg as his hatred broke through the confines of his prison.
 Now freed, it is time you the great hero Tod do your job and stop him with your wand of eternal power and save the world.
